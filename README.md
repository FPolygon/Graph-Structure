# Graph-Structure
The provided header file implements a graph data structure using an adjacency list representation. The `graph` class is a templated class that allows for the storage and manipulation of vertices and edges. Vertices are stored in a vector, while the adjacency list is implemented as an unordered map, associating each vertex with a vector of pairs representing its neighboring vertices and the corresponding edge weights. The class provides functions to add vertices and edges, retrieve edge weights, and obtain information about the graph such as the number of vertices and edges. It also supports operations like finding neighbors of a vertex and obtaining a list of all vertices in the graph. The `dump` function allows for the printing of the graph's internal state for debugging purposes. Overall, this graph implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to represent and work with graphs in C++.
